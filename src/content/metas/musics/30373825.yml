  [00:25:00]Fly me to the moon
  [00:29:00]And let me play among the stars
  [00:34:00]Let me see what spring is like
  [00:38:20]On Jupiter and Mars
  [00:42:00]In other words,
  [00:44:20]Hold my hand
  [00:50:00]In other words,
  [00:53:00]Darling, kiss me
  [00:58:00]Fill my heart with song
  [01:01:00]And let me sing forever more
  [01:07:00]You are all I long for
  [01:10:00]All I worship and adore
  [01:15:00]In other words,
  [01:17:20]please be true
  [01:22:20]In other words,I love you
  [02:04:00]Fly me to the moon
  [02:06:00]And let me play among the stars
  [02:12:00]Let me see what spring is like On Jupiter and Mars
  [02:19:00]In other words,hold my hand
  [02:27:00]In other words,Darling, kiss me
  [02:36:00]Fill my heart with song
  [02:39:00]And let me sing forever more
