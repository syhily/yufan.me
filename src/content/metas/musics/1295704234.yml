  [00:12.984]I read the news today,oh boy
  [00:19.153]About a lucky man who made the grade
  [00:25.218]And though the news was rather sad
  [00:31.427]Well I just had to laugh
  [00:37.762]I saw the photograph
  [00:44.060]He blew his mind out in a car
  [00:50.211]He didn't notice that the lights had changed
  [00:56.645]A crowd of people stood and stared
  [01:02.613]They'd seen his face before
  [01:05.191]Nobody was really sure
  [01:07.049]If he was from the House of Lords.
  [01:10.593]
  [01:11.697]I saw a film today oh boy
  [01:17.868]The English Army had just won the war
  [01:24.041]A crowd of people turned away
  [01:30.293]but I just had to look
  [01:33.663]Having read the book
  [01:38.971]I'd love to turn you on
  [01:46.883]
  [02:21.019]Woke up, fell out of bed,
  [02:23.871]Dragged a comb across my head
  [02:28.259]Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
  [02:31.411]And looking up I noticed I was late.
  [02:35.618]Found my coat and grabbed my hat
  [02:38.562]Made the bus in seconds flat
  [02:43.040]Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
  [02:45.945]and Somebody spoke and I went into a dream
  [02:49.313](Ah....)
  [03:14.394]
  [03:18.524]I read the news today oh boy
  [03:24.285]Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
  [03:30.182]And though the holes were rather small
  [03:36.073]They had to count them all
  [03:38.633]Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.
  [03:44.474]I'd love to turn you on
  [03:53.170]
