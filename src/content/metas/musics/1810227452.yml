  [00:00.000] 作词 : Bri Tolani
  [00:00.325] 作曲 : Bri Tolani
  [00:00.651]You’re my type on paper
  [00:05.272]I’d live in your bed if I could
  [00:09.795]Can you sign this waiver?
  [00:14.269]Just says that you’ll be mine for good
  [00:18.258]
  [00:18.895]I’ve been uncomfortable lately
  [00:23.476]All by myself and I’m waiting for you
  [00:31.032]For you
  [00:32.757]
  [00:34.604]Or you could teach me how
  [00:40.746]How to be alone
  [00:44.749]When no one’s around
  [00:48.637]I get nervous, I’m a burden baby
  [00:54.617]With all these thoughts running through my mind
  [00:59.015]I’m gonna need you to stay the night
  [01:03.606]Or teach me how
  [01:08.228]How to be alone
  [01:11.882]
  [01:13.666]I know I’ve got problems
  [01:18.307]I’ve never been independent
  [01:22.802]I thought I could solve them
  [01:27.445]But I never learned my lesson
  [01:31.324]
  [01:31.980]I’ve been uncomfortable lately
  [01:36.574]All by myself and I’m waiting for you
  [01:44.358]For you
  [01:45.847]
  [01:47.817]Or you could teach me how
  [01:53.844]How to be alone
  [01:57.829]When no one’s around
  [02:01.645]I get nervous, I’m a burden baby
  [02:07.626]With all these thoughts running through my mind
  [02:11.924]I’m gonna need you to stay the night
  [02:16.506]Or teach me how
  [02:21.318]How to be alone
  [02:24.927]
  [02:26.890]I don’t want to be alone tonight
  [02:31.678]I got monsters and they want to fight
  [02:36.130]And yeah I know it’s all in my head
  [02:40.588]They’d go away if you were in my bed
  [02:46.205]
  [02:46.656]Or you could teach me how
  [02:52.803]How to be alone
  [02:56.694]When no one’s around
  [03:00.605]I get nervous, I’m a burden baby
  [03:06.450]With all these thoughts running through my mind
  [03:11.005]I’m gonna need you to stay the night
  [03:15.606]Or teach me how
  [03:20.154]How to be alone
