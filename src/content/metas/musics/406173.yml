  [00:02.78]
  [00:05.03]This is the purpose of changing
  [00:07.01]hydrogen interpret for oxygen
  [00:09.23]and they are necessary here
  [00:12.01]as the air is on earth.
  [00:14.00]But I still say... they're flowers.
  [00:17.05]If you like.
  [00:20.04]Do you sell them?
  [00:21.96]I am afraid Not.
  [00:23.00]But... Maybe we can make a deal.
  [00:35.00]
