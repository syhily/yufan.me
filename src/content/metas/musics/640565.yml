  [00:00.000] 作词 : Rie fu
  [00:00.600] 作曲 : Rie fu
  [00:01.200]Nobody knows who I really am,
  [00:05.620]I never felt this empty before.
  [00:10.300]And if I ever need someone to come along,
  [00:14.980]Who's gonna comfort me and keep me strong?
  [00:20.000]We are all rowing the boat of fate
  [00:24.480]The waves keep on coming and we can't escape
  [00:29.480]But if we ever get lost on our way
  [00:34.040]The waves would guide you through another day
  [00:39.130]遠くで息をしてる
  [00:43.720]透明になったみたい
  [00:49.200]暗闇に思えたけど
  [00:54.150]目隠しされてただけ
  [01:01.800]祈りをささげて
  [01:06.110]新しい日を待つ
  [01:10.910]鮮やかに 光る海
  [01:15.630]その果てまで~
  [01:35.700]Nobody knows who I really am
  [01:40.810]Maybe they just don't give a damn
  [01:45.850]But if I ever need someone to come along
  [01:50.509]I know you will follow me and keep me strong
  [01:55.550]人の心はうつりゆく
  [02:00.120]抜け出したくなる
  [02:04.830]つきはまた新しい周期で
  [02:10.240]舟を連れてく
  [02:17.820]And every time I see your face
  [02:22.640]The oceans heave up to my heart
  [02:27.380]You make me wanna strain at the oars
  [02:32.120]And soon I can't see the shore
  [02:41.950]Oh, I can't see the shore...
  [02:51.550]When will I see the shore?
  [03:04.530]I want you to know who I really am
  [03:09.170]I never thought I‘d feel this way towards you
  [03:13.780]And if you ever need someone to come along
  [03:18.710]I will follow you and keep you strong
  [03:24.500]旅はまだ続いてく
  [03:28.630]穏やかな日も
  [03:33.210]つきはまた新しい周期で
  [03:38.840]舟を照らし出す
  [03:46.300]祈りをささげて
  [03:50.880]新しい日を待つ
  [03:55.440]鮮やかに 光る海
  [04:00.540]その果てまで
  [04:05.730]And everytime I see your face
  [04:10.380]The oceans heave up to my heart
  [04:15.900]You make me wanna strain at the oars
  [04:20.000]And soon I can see the shore
  [04:27.730]運命の舟を漕ぎ
  [04:32.840]波は次から次へと
  [04:37.590]私たちを襲うけど
  [04:42.400]それも素敵な旅ね
  [04:47.280]どれも素敵な旅ね
