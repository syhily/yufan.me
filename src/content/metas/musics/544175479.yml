  [00:00.476]See how much I love you -Skelters
  [00:11.324]From the first day I saw you
  [00:16.341]I felt something inside me
  [00:21.794]I didn't know what it was
  [00:24.660]But now I know
  [00:29.695]Girl it was you
  [00:36.649]You are my only thought
  [00:41.575]Through the days and nights
  [00:46.755]I tried so hard just
  [00:49.742]To get a smile from you
  [00:56.589]Only a smile
  [01:02.61]See how much I love you
  [01:04.951]And see how much
  [01:06.321]I care about you
  [01:12.235]And try to understand me
  [01:15.206]Because I love you
  [01:27.248]We had some good
  [01:28.965]Times together
  [01:32.301]But now they're all over
  [01:35.648]Because of me
  [01:40.832]Because of me
  [01:47.283]I tried so many times
  [01:49.980]To forget you
  [01:52.278]But I returned to you
  [01:55.11]And I started every cry
  [01:59.741]Because
  [02:01.149]I couldn't live without you
  [02:06.275]I couldn't live without you
  [02:12.850]See how much I love you
  [02:15.903]And see how much
  [02:17.74]I care about you
  [02:22.823]And try to understand me
  [02:25.807]Because I love you
  [03:33.679]See how much I love you
  [03:36.621]And see how much
  [03:37.850]I care about you
  [03:43.889]And try to understand me
  [03:46.820]Because I love you
  [03:53.928]See how much I love you
  [03:57.162]Baby I care about you
  [04:04.27]And try to understand me
  [04:06.876]Because I love you
