# Iconfont Tutorial

This is the directory for storing the iconfont that used for this blog. All the icons are exported in SVG format.

You can add, edit or remove the SVG files in the [icons](./icons/) directory. Remember that all the SVG file names should start with `icon-`.

Finally, go to [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select) and upload all the icons to generate the font to use.
