// would drag those bytes into the wp-admin SPA chunk through that lazy
// graph. Keep this file CSS-free; mount `<PublicChrome>` instead when you

        Fixed-position widget rail anchored bottom-right.

        The legacy `.site-fixed-widget` rule used `bottom: 0;
        transform: translateY(-50%)` to centre a 44 px button on the
        viewport's bottom edge — it relied on the fact that 50% of
        the rail's own height matches half the button. That trick
        coupled the offset to the button height, made the rail's
        `transform` fight `transform-gpu` for the same property, and
        on iOS Safari placed the rail flush against the fold where
        the URL-bar collapse animation repaints every frame (a
        reliable rendering-ghost trigger).

        Stage 11 P9 collapsed the trick into a plain `bottom-5`
        (= 20 px) offset, mirroring `right-5` for visual symmetry
        and giving the rail a stable resting position that does NOT
        depend on its own height. `transform-gpu` is now free to
        own the `transform` property by itself, so iOS Safari
        keeps the rail on a clean compositor layer through URL-bar
        collapse and inertial scroll.

        The `9999` z-index is the legacy "above everything" value —
        kept as a single bare token (`z-9999`) because no other
        public widget needs to sit at the same layer (Lesson 8 —
        sole consumer; promoting it to a named token would only
        buy verbosity).

        The legacy `.site-fixed-widget li { margin: 0 0 1rem }`
        per-item bottom-spacing rule is dead today: the only `<li>`
        in this `<ul>` is `<ScrollTopButton>`, and `<li>` already
        starts at `margin: 0` via reset.css's un-layered `li
        { margin: 0 }` rule.

        The floating ThemeToggle is mobile-only (`<lg`). On `>=lg` the
        Header's social rail is always visible and already carries a
        theme switch next to Search; surfacing a second control there
        would just duplicate it. Below `lg` the side menu folds behind
        the hamburger, so the rail-bound toggle becomes unreachable
        without opening the drawer — the floating widget restores
        one-tap parity. `flex flex-col gap-2` stacks the pair with an
        8px gutter; `ScrollTopButton`'s opacity-based hide leaves a
        spacer when scrolled to the top, which is fine — the rail
        stays visually anchored to the bottom-right.
