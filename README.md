# yufan.me

[![Folo](https://badge.folo.is/feed/54772566650461214?color=FF5C00&labelColor=black&style=flat-square)](https://app.folo.is/share/feeds/54772566650461214)

Source code for [yufan.me](https://yufan.me) — a self-hosted blog CMS
running on React Router 7 (SSR), Hono, and oRPC. Posts, pages,
taxonomies, comments, images, music, and per-section settings all live
in Postgres and are edited from the built-in `/admin` console.
Bodies are stored as **PortableText** and authored through a Tiptap
editor that round-trips losslessly to the wire format.

The repository is the whole product: the public site, the admin SPA,
the API perimeter, the SSR renderer, the install gate, and the database
schema/migrations.

> **Contributors:** start at [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — it documents the
> import boundaries, the four-layer `src/server/` graph, the install
> contract, the API permission matrix, and the Vite+ (`vp`) toolchain
> expectations.

## Highlights

- **Postgres-backed content model.** Posts (`/posts/:slug`) and pages
  (`/:slug`) share one global slug namespace; categories, tags, and
  friends are first-class taxonomies with referential integrity. Page
  drafts get an admin-only preview overlay; future-dated posts stay
  excluded until publish time.
- **PortableText body, Tiptap editor.** A single `@/shared/pt/schema`
  Zod dialect is the wire format. The PT ↔ ProseMirror bridge
  (`@/shared/pt/bridge`) is a single file; standard blocks map to
  Tiptap built-ins, custom blocks (`image`, `code`, `mathBlock`,
  `mermaid`, `musicPlayer`, `solution`, `footnoteDefinition`, `table`)
  ride a generic `blockCard` node. Round-trip is contract-tested.
- **Typed API, end-to-end.** Every HTTP call goes through `/rpc/*` via
  oRPC. Procedures are declared from one of four base procedures
  (`publicProc` / `authedProc` / `authorProc` / `adminProc`) and the
  browser client is built from `typeof apiRouter`. Zod DTOs in
  `shared/contracts/` are paired with compile-time parity assertions
  against `shared/types/`.
- **Section-scoped settings.** 14 JSONB rows under `setting` —
  `blog.general`, `blog.assets`, `blog.navigation`, `blog.socials`,
  `blog.content`, `blog.sidebar`, `blog.comments`, `blog.seo`,
  `blog.footer`, `blog.mail`, `blog.cache`, `blog.rateLimit`,
  `blog.search`, `blog.fonts`. Each section saves independently so
  concurrent admin tabs cannot race.
- **Two-stage install gate.** Until an admin row exists, every request
  redirects to `/admin/setup`. After admin creation, stage 2
  at `/admin/setup/settings` writes the 14 settings rows
  atomically.
- **Optional object storage.** S3 (or any S3-compatible bucket) is
  gated by `assets.storage.enabled`. Off by default — the library is
  read-only and uploads return 503 until a settings flip. Generated
  Vite assets ship with the build image; S3 is for user media only.
- **First-party analytics.** Visit ingestion + dashboards backed by
  Postgres, with optional MaxMind GeoLite2 enrichment.

## Architecture

Five cooperating top-level layers under `src/` with a one-way import
graph (`routes → server / ui / client / shared`; `server → shared`;
`shared` stays isomorphic).

```
src/
├── routes/      Route modules grouped into public/, auth/, admin/
├── server/      SSR-only: infra/, domains/, http/, render/
├── client/      Hooks, oRPC client, browser-only code
├── ui/          Pure-props React components (public, admin, shadcn primitives, PortableText renderer)
├── shared/      Isomorphic config, contracts, DTO types, PT schema, utils
├── assets/      Fonts, icons, global CSS
└── server.ts    Hono entry / SSR adapter
```

The `src/server/` tree is itself four layers, in strict order
(`infra → domains → http`, `domains → render → http`):

- **`infra/`** — Drizzle pool, Redis storage, generic HTTP vocabulary,
  email, search, env, logger, rate limiter, slug pipeline. Zero
  business knowledge.
- **`domains/`** — One folder per business concept (`auth`, `catalog`,
  `pages`, `posts`, `comments`, `images`, `music`, `friends`,
  `taxonomies`, `settings`, `users`, `analytics`, `pt`, …). Locked
  vocabulary: `schema.ts / repo.ts / service.ts / projection.ts /
cache.ts`.
- **`http/`** — Hono entry, oRPC procedure base, controllers,
  middlewares, resource routers (RSS, sitemap, OG, redirects), React
  Router loaders. Orchestration only — no business rules.
- **`render/`** — SSR output products: SEO meta, RSS/Atom, OG images,
  calendar SVGs, avatar fetch, react-prerender drain, image
  post-processing. Never persists.

Deeper rationale and the rules each layer enforces live in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syhily/yufan.me.git
cd yufan.me
cp .env.example .env
vp install
vp dev
```

Minimum `.env`:

```text
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db
REDIS_URL=redis://host:6379
SESSION_SECRET=<high-entropy secret>
```

Optional: `MAXMIND_DB_PATH` for geo-enriched analytics,
`ANALYTICS_TRACK_ADMIN` to include admin visits in dashboards.

First boot redirects every request to `/admin/setup` until an
admin row exists; stage 2 at `/admin/setup/settings` then
seeds the 14 settings rows. After that the public site is live and the
admin console at `/admin` is available to the new admin user.

## Content model

| Surface           | Storage                           | Public URL                                  | Admin surface              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Posts             | `post` + `content` (PortableText) | `/posts/:slug`                              | `/admin/posts`             |
| Pages             | `page` + `content` (PortableText) | `/:slug`                                    | `/admin/pages`             |
| Categories / tags | Postgres                          | `/cats/:slug`, `/tags/:slug`                | `/admin/{categories,tags}` |
| Friends           | Postgres                          | Friends grid (page meta toggle)             | `/admin/friends`           |
| Images            | Postgres + optional S3            | `<assetsHost>/images/...`                   | `/admin/images`            |
| Music             | Postgres + optional S3            | Embedded in PortableText via 16-char nanoid | `/admin/musics`            |
| Comments          | Postgres (threaded, with likes)   | Inline on posts/pages, moderation in admin  | `/admin/comments`          |

Slug generation runs through one server-side helper
(`@/server/infra/slug::deriveSlug`) — `pinyin-pro` → whitespace
collapse → `github-slugger`. The page↔post namespace is global and
enforced at catalog build time. Heading anchors are pre-computed at
SSR so deep links survive across re-renders.

## Admin console

The `/admin` SPA shares one Tiptap editor for posts and pages with
a three-layer UX: top toolbar (image library / music picker / link /
table / hr / undo-redo), floating bubble menus for text and table
selections, and a `/`-driven slash menu for block insertion. Cells are
inline-only and the image block is a React NodeView for inline alt +
caption editing.

The console also covers user management, sessions, taxonomy CRUD, the
analytics dashboard (overview + realtime), an image library with
inline category/friend uploads (locked to 1280×425), a music library
with per-track lyrics, and per-section settings pages.

## API & permissions

Every dynamic non-page request goes through the oRPC router at
`/rpc/*`. The permission matrix is encoded in the **base procedure**
each leaf picks:

| Base         | Guard                          | Use for                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `publicProc` | No auth gate; CSRF on non-GET  | Anonymous reads + mutations |
| `authedProc` | `requireAuth` + CSRF           | Any logged-in user          |
| `authorProc` | `requireRole('author')` + CSRF | Authors and admins          |
| `adminProc`  | `requireRole('admin')` + CSRF  | Admins only                 |

Audit the entire surface with one grep:

```bash
grep -rn "adminProc\|authorProc\|authedProc\|publicProc" src/server/http/controllers/
```

OpenAPI is auto-generated from the router in development at
`/openapi.json` and `/docs`. Non-JSON output (RSS/Atom, sitemap, OG
images, redirects, analytics events) is served by native Hono resource
routers under `src/server/http/resources/`.

## Commands

```bash
vp dev              # dev server + HMR
vp check            # format, lint, types
vp test             # watch tests
vp test run         # CI-style test run
vp build            # production build
vp preview          # serve production build locally
vp run db:generate  # Drizzle migration from schema edits
```

Use `vp add` / `vp remove` / `vp update` for packages — don't call
`npm` / `pnpm` / `yarn` directly. The reasons (and the Vite+ pitfalls)
are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Configuration

Runtime behaviour is driven by the `setting` table — **one JSONB row
per section** under `scope='blog.<section>'`. There is no checked-in
`blog.config.ts` or global defaults file; each section's schema lives
beside its service in `src/server/domains/settings/` and the registry
in `sections.ts` maps section ↔ DB scope ↔ Zod schema ↔ bundle key.

The S3 toggle, credentials, bucket, asset CDN host, and upload limits
all live under `setting('blog.assets')` (edited at
`/admin/settings/assets`) — not in env vars. The dispatcher reads
the toggle on every PUT/DELETE so flipping storage on/off does not
require a redeploy.

## Deployment

The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) runs `npm run build` against a Node 25
Alpine base and ships `build/` with `npm run start`
(`react-router-serve`). Default listen port `4321`. Generated Vite
assets are **not** uploaded to S3 by the build; object storage is
reserved for user media. Migrations under `drizzle/` are copied into
the runtime image and applied by your deployment workflow before
boot.
