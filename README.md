# Yufan Personal Blog

[![Deployed on Zeabur](https://img.shields.io/badge/Host-zeabur-blue)](https://zeabur.com/referral?referralCode=syhily&utm_source=syhily) [![Folo](https://badge.folo.is/feed/54772566650461214?color=FF5C00&labelColor=black&style=flat-square)](https://app.folo.is/share/feeds/54772566650461214) ![Astro](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-astro/tiny.svg)

This is the source code for [yufan.me](https://yufan.me).

## History

The source code has gone through four major stages:

- Initially, it was built with WordPress in 2011.
- In 2017, the blog migrated to Hexo, and all posts were converted to Markdown.
- By 2024, the blog was completely rewritten using Next.js with the App Router.
- Currently, it has transitioned to Astro.

## Local Development

The blog’s configuration is managed by the `.env` file.
Use the commands below to set up and run a local instance.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Debugging with break points

If you want to debug using breakpoints, open the project in VSCode and run the development server directly within it.

## Writing

All posts should be placed in the `src/content/posts` directory in MDX format.
All static pages should be placed in the `src/content/pages` directory, also in MDX format.
You can include custom scripts or components by leveraging MDX capabilities.

### Front Matter

Front Matter is a YAML block at the top of a file used to configure settings for your writing.
It is enclosed by triple dashes.

```yaml
---
title: Hello World
date: 2013/7/13 20:46:25

```

## Blog Design

Most design assets are contained in [yufan.me.sketch](docs/yufan.me.sketch).
I primarily use [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) as my design tool.

The favicon closely resembles the blog logo, with simplified elements for better readability at smaller sizes.
It retains the main shape from the logo but adjusts the dot color for visibility.
The background color is embedded in the exported favicon to ensure clear display across all browsers.

The favicon sizing follows this
[tutorial](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs)
to ensure compatibility across platforms.
